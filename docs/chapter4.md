[Consumer IAM with IBM Security Verify Demo](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/customer-and-ctp-demos-for-ciam?history=/collection/ibm-security-verify-demos/journey-verify-saa-s) <br>
Consumer Identity and Access Management is not easy. Most businesses are interacting and collecting information from their users online at an increasing rate. That data needs to be used by various systems creating backend challenges. Meanwhile consumers expect frictionless experiences and control over their data. Rising concerns over data privacy regulations, identity theft, and fraud are making it more difficult to deliver personalized and engaging user experiences.

IBM Security Verify is well positioned to address these issues. With a robust set of APIs that can be embedded in end user experiences, a data privacy and consent module, and a user registration form builder, Verify can ensure consent is collected, audited, and all documents are maintained.
